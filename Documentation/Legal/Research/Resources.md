Once in a while we get asked a question or too - so here's your questions and some answers!

## Where do the clothes go?

You choose the laundromat, and your driver brings it there. You can keep track of where's it's going and when it's back as well!

## What products / Process do they use

We have some standard products we reccomend, of which you can find here:

While these are reccommended, they are not required. If the clothes do not meet your personal cleanliness requirement they certainly do not meet ours, and reach out to us at customersupportfreshnclean@gmail.com

## What happens if my products are stolen?

We take claims of stolen laundry very seriously.

If you havee a claim, please email customer support at customersupportfreshnclean@gmail.com. Make sure to provide all relevant details, including:

- The time of the incident
- A description of the stolen elements.
- And any other pieces of supporting elements (e.g. photos, receipts, communications etc.)

Then, Fresh n' Clean will investigate thoroughly and consult both parties. We'll keep everyone updated though the process. 

If there are legal and insurance claims, we may have to consult legal services. For requesting data see INSERT THIRD PARTY DATA REQUESTS FORM

Actions taken from a claim can be very serious, up to a permanent suspension from our serice. See our COMMUNITY GUIDELINES INSERT LINK for more information.

Addionally, we reccomend ensuring your items are packed securely and labeled properly, as well as retaining recepits and records as prevention measures and to keep yourself safe.

## What happens if someone reports something stolen that isn't?

This is very malicoius and we obviously take this very seriously. We go the the process listed above, and when we get the stolen report we will take appriopriate action on the reporter.

## What happens if my clothes are tampered with?

Again, this would go through our report system at customersupportfreshnclean@gmail.com and will likely result in a ban for the person who tampered with the clothes.
