# General Community Guidelines

https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=general-community-guidelines&country=united-states&lang=en

## Description

Describes how Uber expects everyone to act when taking part in their services as a driver or customer. Says if you violate them Uber reserves the right to boot you from their platform.

Some examples of their guidelines include:

- Treat everyone with respect
- Don't touch strangers or anyone you meet
- Sexual Assault / contact / behavior of any kind is prohibited
- Threatenting / rude behavior is prohibited
- Post trip contact of any kind (unless to return a lost item) is prohibited
- Discrimination isn't allowed
- Property damage isn't allowed
- No interacting with strangers in a variety of ways
- No scamming Uber
- No breaking the law
- Be safe, wear seat belts and helmets
- Drive safe
- How to handle emergencies
- **Proper handling of uber eats orders**
- **Proper delivery of uber eats orders**
- **How to create a safe space for uber eats deliveries**
- **Creating a positive experience for delivery people and Uber Eats users**
- **Prohibited items for Uber eats**
- Delivering alcohol
- More emphasis on not breaking the law
- Encouraging people to give feedback

Ending with how Uber enforces all these guidelines, mostly with describing the judicial process and then how Uber is allowed to take action through limiting / removing your access to Uber services.

Quote from the very bottom of the document: ***"Drivers and delivery people are not agents (actual, ostensible, or otherwise) or employees of Uber. They are independent third-party providers."***
