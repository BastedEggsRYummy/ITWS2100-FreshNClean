# Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy

https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=unsolicited-idea-submission-policy&country=united-states&lang=en

## Description

Describes how if someone suggests something to Uber, Uber has complete ownership of your submission and no obligation to review or use it. If Uber does something that is similar to your submission, Uber has no responsibiily to compensate you.

This is to protect them from people suggesting things, Uber using similar ideas intentially or through an unrelated means and the original person suing for money.

Uber discourages people from sending suggestions to them or their affiliates to avoid this headache for everyone.
