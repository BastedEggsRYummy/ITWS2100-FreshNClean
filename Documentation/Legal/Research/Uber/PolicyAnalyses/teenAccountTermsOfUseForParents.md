# Uber Teen Terms of Use - Parents or Guardians

https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=uber-teens-terms-of-use---parents-or-guardians&country=united-states&lang=en

## Description

Explains the additional terms a customer is agreeing to when they sign their teen (ages 13-17) up for a 'Teen Account'.

Most of the normal terms still apply to them, however there is additional responsibility placed on the adult creating the account. They consent to Uber communicating communicating with the teen and doubling down on many things said in the general documentation such as:
- Only the person with the account and their guests can use the account.
- Don't break the law.
- The drivers are allowed to do normal driver things like record their vehicle and using their other rights.
- The privacy notice, community guidelines, general terms of use and reserve terms of use all still apply.

## Relevancy to this project

Probably yes - If we want minors to be able to use the app we'll need seperate legal documentation letting them.
