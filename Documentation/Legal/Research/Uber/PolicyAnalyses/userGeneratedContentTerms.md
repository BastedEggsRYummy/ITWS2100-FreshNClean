# User Generated Content Policy

https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=user-generated-content-policy&country=united-states&lang=en

## Description

Explains that whilst in Uber's app you do have freedom of speech, Uber reserves the right to do a number of things with user content. This includes:
- Uber reserves the right to use, copy, modify, create derrivative works of, distribute, publicly display/preform, and generally exploit UGC (user generated content) for whatever reason, without notifying or consent from the person who made it.
- You own the content you released but Uber still has the right to do more or less whatever they want to or with it.
- You won't use the UGC in an illegal way.
- You assume all risk with your UGC.
- You won't break Uber's other rules with your UGC.
- You won't impersonate anyone with your UGC.
- You won't try and break into other people's accounts using your UGC.
- You won't automate the use of Uber.
- You won't promote your own business venture through Uber.

By using Uber you hold Uber and it's affiliates harmless against any claims and damages from the UGC. If your account is deleted it doesn't absolve you of responsibility.

Uber reserves the right to punish you within their services if you break their UGC terms.

## Relevancy to this project

Yes - we will have UGC and we need to police it.
