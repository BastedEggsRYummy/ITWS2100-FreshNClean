# Uber Teen Terms of Use - Teens

https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=uber-teens-terms-of-use---teens&country=united-states&lang=en

## Description

Repeats many things said in the other legal documentations, reiterating for people using a 'Teen Account'. Much of this documentation is more or less copy and pasted from the version for adults, just minus the section giving the adults partial responsibility.

## Relevancy to this project

Probably yes - If we want minors to be able to use the app we'll need seperate legal documentation letting them.
