# Community Guidelines

Here at Fresh n' Clean we strive to make every experience positive, safe and respectful. This applies to everyone who uses our platform when interacting through the Fresh n' Clean interface or with Fresh n' Clean employees or contractors. Additionally these guidelines apply to instances outside the Fresh n' Clean platform when that conduct may threaten the safety of the platform.

Thank you for joining us in supporting and safeguarding a welcoming environment.

These guidelines are here to encourage positive, uplifting communication within our service. Everyone, whether it be our contractors, laundromat representatives or customers deserve to have a positive experience. Yes, that includes you! We also want to discourage bad behavoir and breaking these community guidelines may result in partial or full loss of access from our platform.

Making sure you adhere to these guidelines helps to ensure we keep Fresh n' Clean as squeaky clean as your laundry. Not following these guidelines can constitute a breach of the community guidelines and may be punished within Fresh n' Clean as seen fit, with punishments scaling up to a full removal from our platform. You can report potential violations of our community guidelines to us at freshandclean@gmail.com and we'll address any report in accordance with our policies. We update these guidelines regularly and would love to hear your suggestions. Thank you for contributing to keeping Fresh n' Clean a safe and positive place!

# The Hard Rules

## Treat Everyone with Respect

It's the golden rule: treat everyone how you'd like to be treated. And no, we know you don't want to be treated like how you treat that t-shirt that still stinks of last week's soccer game. Gross!

You are expected to treat everyone with good judgement and courtesy. Slamming doors, yelling, swearing, leaving trash and throwing personal items are common courtesy not to do. It's expected you tidy up after yourself and provide the dirty laundry in a clean bag that will then be returned. It's also expected that you provide the laundry without excess non-clothing items; we know your clothes are dirty, but you shouldn't give your contractors a bag of mud with some clothes. Remember: treat everyone with respect.

We are a No-Discrimination company as well and discrimination of any kind is strictly prohibited. Look at our NO-DISCRIMINATION POLICY for more details. Just know that if you violate this we reserve the right for all the punishments already mentioned and will strive to create a comfortable environment for everyone.

## Physical Contact

Don't touch strangers or people you just met. Physical Contact of any kind is not allowed. Limited exceptions are permitted for people needing or requesting physical assistance. Hurting or intending to hurt anyone is never allowed.

## Sexual Assault and Misconduct

Sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexual midconduct in general is all strictly prohibited. Respect personal space, respect others privacy, and treat everyone with respect. It's okay to have respectful conversations; however sexual harassment such as commenting on someone's appearance or their relationship status is innappropriate and violates this policy.

We also have a no-sex rule regardless of your relationship with the person and their consent. We're cleaning your sheets for goodness sake, keep them clean until you get home please.

Threatening and rude behavior is not allowed. Aggressive, confrontational or harassing behavior that could be disrespectful, discriminatory, threatening or inappropriate violates our conduct. This includes languages and gestures both online and in-person.

## Post Trip Contact

Contact should end when the laundry delivery is complete, with the only exception being for returning a lost item. Unwanted contact can be seen as harassment. Any sort of attempt at communication post-service could be seen as harassment and is therefore not allowed.

## Discrimination

It's incredibly important to us here at Fresh n' Clean that everyone here feels safe and welcome. That's why we have a no-tolerance attitude towards racism and discriminatory conduct or behavior. Do not discriminate or engage in a disparaging manner towards someone based on traits such as their race, ethnicity, skin color, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law. Here are some additional examples of discriminatory behavior:

Discriminating based on the destination of the customer.

Refusing to wash some or all of the clothes due to the type of clothing given.

Using discriminatory language, making discriminatory remarks, vilifying, or asking questions about sensitive topics regarding national origin, race, ethnicity, or any other trait previously mentioned. Making racist comments or using slurs is never allowed.

## Property Damage

Damaging Property is never allowed. Some examples include damaging the driver's car or damaging the client's clothing. Breaking, vandalizing, intentionally spilling food, smoking and vomiting all constitute property damage. Intentional damage may result in account deactivation.

# Keep each other safe

There's a lot of moving parts in this operation and a lof people's personal belongings, money and time are involved. This only works because we have such a good community keeping each other safe. Everyone has a role in that, so here's some tips on you can keep yourself and everyone around you safe.

## Account sharing

Account sharing isn't allowed. Drivers must do all the work themselves, and clients may not use other clients' accounts. Everyone needs to know who they are talking to. If you're found to be account sharing you are liable to account action, up to suspension of your account.

## People under the age of 18

People under the age of 18 are not permitted to use our app as of right now. Whilst we might implement a teen account in the future, right now a teen's parent or guardian must use the app for the teen.

## Vehicle information

For an easy pickup or delivery, the Fresh n' Clean service gives users identifying information about drivers and delivery people and their vehicles, including their license plate number, vehicle make and model, profile picture, and name. Drivers and delivery people must complete trips and deliveries using only approved vehicles.

## Seat belts

Every delivery person using a vehicle, every driver, and every rider—including those in the back seat—should always buckle up. Riders should request a vehicle that has enough seat belts for everyone in their party.

Additionally, all laundry must be secured to a seat, preferably using a seat belt. Laundry found laying on the floor of the vehicle is grounds for suspension as it's unsanitary.

## Use of dash cams that record video and/or audio

Drivers may choose to install and use a dashcam, which can be used to record rides and provide evidence to Fresh n' Clean, law enforcement, or insurance companies in the event that something goes wrong on a ride. Drivers and riders may choose to use their phones to record rides as well. Please note:

In some locations, local laws and regulations require that a rider provide consent to being recorded and/or be notified of recording in advance. Please check your local laws to understand your responsibilities.

Drivers may submit recordings to Fresh n' Clean at their discretion. Fresh n' Clean will review submitted footage and take all action consistent with the Community Guidelines and platform terms of use.

Sharing or streaming a person’s image or audio or video recording on social media or in other digital or physical public locations is a violation of our Community Guidelines and may prompt further investigation by our safety team.

## Proper maintenance and upkeep
Pursuant to the terms of their agreement with Fresh n' Clean and applicable regulations, drivers and delivery people are expected to keep their vehicles maintained and in good operating condition. This means maintaining their vehicle according to industry safety and maintenance standards, and monitoring for and repairing any parts that are recalled by the vehicle manufacturer.

## Drive safely and carefully
Drivers are expected to maintain an environment that makes riders feel safe; even if driving practices don’t violate the law, reports of dangerous driving can lead to the loss of access to part or all of Fresh n' Clean's service.

## Emergencies
In case of an emergency or if you find yourself in immediate danger, alert your local authorities or emergency services before notifying Fresh n' Clean.

We take threats of suicide and self-harm seriously and may reach out to authorities to request a wellness check if we receive notification that there is an imminent risk of self-harm.

For public emergencies, Fresh n' Clean may take additional measures to try to preserve the safety of our platform, including but not limited to natural disasters, public health emergencies, and public crisis situations.

## Laundry Cleanliness

Drivers who handle laundry are expected to maintain a high level of cleanliness. We further encourage people to read about this in our INSERT DOCUMENT NAME HERE. Note that breaking this policy is immediate grounds for suspension: We take cleanliness here very seriously.

## Proper delivery of orders (information for delivery people)
Merchants may outline certain delivery guidelines that adhere to regulatory guidance.

Delivery people should deliver orders safely and in accordance with relevant safety standards. For example, they may not tamper with or open packaging during delivery.

## How merchants can provide a safe space for pickups
Merchants and their staff are expected to exercise good judgment and behavior around delivery people, make them feel welcome, and provide a safe area for order pickups

## Creating a positive experience for delivery people and Fresh n' Clean users
Long preparation times, long delivery person handoff times (how long it takes for the delivery person to get in and out of the merchant’s location with the order, including wait time), low online time (a merchant’s online availability time), long delays before order acceptance, and high cancellation rates also create a negative experience for Fresh n' Clean users and delivery people.

If a merchant’s metrics are below the minimum standard for its city, we will let them know.

## Prohibited items
Merchants may only offer for sale items expressly contemplated under their agreement with Fresh n' Clean.

# Follow the law
We have standards based on applicable laws and regulations that everyone must follow. For example, using the Fresh n' Clean platform to commit any crime—such as transporting drugs, money laundering, committing drug or human trafficking, or sexually exploiting children—or to violate any other law is strictly prohibited.

## Follow all laws
We’re committed to following all applicable laws and earning your trust, and we expect everyone who uses the Fresh n' Clean Platform to do their part and to know and adhere to relevant laws and regulations, including traffic laws, as well as airport rules and regulations where applicable.

For Fresh n' Clean users, let your driver or delivery person handle the driving. We don't need too many cooks in the kitchen.

## Drugs and alcohol
Drug use and open containers of alcohol are never allowed while using the Fresh n' Clean Platform. If a customer is too drunk or rowdy, drivers have the right to decline the trip for their own safety.

If you’re a user and you have reason to believe your driver may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, ask the driver to end the trip immediately. Then call 911. Additionally, please also report your experience to Fresh n' Clean.

## Firearms ban
Riders and their guests, as well as drivers and delivery people, are prohibited from carrying firearms while using the Fresh n' Clean Platform, to the extent permitted by applicable law. You can learn more about our Firearms Prohibition Policy here.

## Fraud
Deception can weaken trust and also be dangerous. Intentionally falsifying information or assuming someone else’s identity isn’t allowed. It is important to provide accurate information when reporting incidents, creating and accessing your Fresh n' Clean accounts, disputing charges or fees, and requesting credits.

## Intellectual property guidelines
Never use Fresh n' Clean's trademark or intellectual property without permission. Drivers and delivery people should also return Fresh n' Clean-branded items to Fresh n' Clean if they lose access to the platform. The use of unauthorized or third-party items—such as lights, placards, signs, or similar items bearing Fresh n' Clean's name or trademark—may confuse riders or Fresh n' Clean users.

## Your feedback matters
If something happens, whether it’s good or bad, we make it easy for you to tell us. Our team is continually improving our standards, and your feedback is important to keep our standards relevant as our technology evolves. Please rate your experience at the end of each trip or delivery. And if something happens—such as a traffic accident—and you want to report it, you can tap Help in the app or visit help.FreshNClean.com so that our Support team can follow up. In case of an emergency or if you find yourself in immediate danger, alert your local authorities or emergency services before notifying Fresh n' Clean.

Fresh n' Clean may at times permit or allow you and others who use the Fresh n' Clean Platform or Fresh n' Clean tools or social media channels to create, submit, upload, publish, email, send messages, or otherwise make available textual, audio, or visual content and information to Fresh n' Clean or users. Such activity and content is subject to Fresh n' Clean's User Generated Content Terms.

## Ratings
Drivers, riders, delivery people, Fresh n' Clean users, and merchants can give and receive ratings, as well as give feedback on how the trip or delivery went.

Minimum average ratings may vary in each city based on factors like cultural differences in the way people in different cities rate each other. Drivers, riders, delivery people, or merchants who don’t meet the minimum average ratings for their city may lose access to all or part of the Fresh n' Clean Platform. If your ratings are approaching the minimum limit, we will let you know and may share information that may help you improve your ratings.

## Delivery, order, and trip acceptance

If you’re a delivery person or driver and you don’t want to accept delivery or trip requests, you can just go offline or log off. If you’re a merchant, use the Pause New Orders feature or make specific items unavailable. For delivery people, drivers, and merchants, if you consistently decline consecutive trip or order requests, our technology may assume you do not want to accept more trips or orders or have forgotten to log out, and your account may be temporarily toggled offline. However, you are free to log back in whenever you wish to begin confirming availability for trips or orders again.

For delivery people, you may lose access to all delivery opportunities if you consistently cancel after accepting requests.

## How Fresh n' Clean enforces our guidelines
If you violate any terms of your contractual agreement(s) with Fresh n' Clean, or any applicable terms or policies, including any one of these Community Guidelines or any additional policies and standards that are communicated by Fresh n' Clean to you from time to time, you can lose access to all or part of the Fresh n' Clean Platform. If you have more than one Fresh n' Clean account, such as a rider account and a driver account or business account, violating the Community Guidelines could also lead you to lose access to all Fresh n' Clean accounts. If you believe an error caused you to lose access to your account, you may contact the Fresh n' Clean Support team.

Fresh n' Clean receives feedback through a variety of channels, reviews reports submitted to our Support team that may violate our Community Guidelines, and may investigate through a specialized team. If we are made aware of potentially problematic behavior, we may contact you so we can look into it. We may, at our sole discretion, put a hold on your account or turn your account inactive until our review is complete.

Not following any one of our guidelines may result in the loss of access to all or part of the Fresh n' Clean Platform. This can include reported violations of our Community Guidelines and certain actions you may take outside of the Fresh n' Clean Platform, including but not limited to information from other platforms, if we determine that those actions threaten the safety of the Fresh n' Clean community, our employees, and contractors, or cause harm to Fresh n' Clean's brand, reputation, or business. And if the issues raised are serious or a repeat report, or you refuse to cooperate, you may lose access to the Fresh n' Clean Platform. Any behavior involving discrimination, violence, sexual misconduct, harassment, fraud, or deceptive, illegal, or unsafe activity, while using the Fresh n' Clean Platform can result in the immediate loss of access to the Fresh n' Clean Platform. Additionally, when law enforcement is involved, we will cooperate with their investigation in accordance with our Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities for the US, found here, and for outside the US, found here. Lastly, all drivers and delivery people wanting to use the Fresh n' Clean Platform undergo a screening process, including motor vehicle record and criminal background checks. A driver or delivery person will lose access to their Fresh n' Clean account(s) if a motor vehicle record check, criminal background check, or other check uncovers a matter relevant to their use of the Fresh n' Clean Platform in violation of criteria required by local regulators.

Users and Fresh n' Clean users can access Terms of Use for the United States here and Terms and Conditions for Canada here. Drivers and delivery people can access their legal agreement with Fresh n' Clean here.
