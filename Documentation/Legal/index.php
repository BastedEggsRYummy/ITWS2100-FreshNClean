        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Hard Rules</h2>
        <h3>Treat Everyone with Respect</h3>
        <p>It's the golden rule: treat everyone how you'd like to be treated. And no, we know you don't want to be treated like how you treat that t-shirt that still stinks of last week's soccer game. Gross!</p>
        <p>You are expected to treat everyone with good judgement and courtesy. Slamming doors, yelling, swearing, leaving trash and thowing personal items are common courtesy not to do. It's expected you tidy up after yourself and provide the dirty laundry in a clean bag that will then be returned. It's also expected that you provde the laundry without excess non-clothing items; we know your clothes are dirty, but you shouldn't give your contractors a bag of mud with some clothes. Remember: treat everyone with respect.</p>
        <p>We are a No-Discrimination company as well and discrimination of any kind is strictly prohibited. Look at our <a href="nonDiscriminationPolicy.php">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> for more details. Just know that if you violate this we reserve the right for all the punishments already mentioned and will strive to create a confortable environment for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Physical Contact</h3>
        <p>Don't touch strangers of people you just met. Physical Contact of any kind is not allowed. Limited exceptions are permitted for people needing or requesting physical assistance. Hurting or intending to hurt anyone is never allowed.</p>

        <h3>Sexual Assault and Misconduct</h3>
        <p>Sexual assult, sexual harassment and sexual midconduct in general is all strictly prohibited. Respect personal space, respect other's privacy, and treat everyone with respect. It's okay to have respectful conversations; however sexual harassment such as commenting on someone's appearance or their relationship status is innapropriate and violates this policy.</p>
        <p>We also have a no-sex rule regardless of your relationship with the person and their consent. We're cleaning your sheets for goodness sake, keep them clean until you get home please.</p>
        <p>Threatening and rude behavoir is not allowed. Agressive, confrontational or harassing behvior that could be direspectful, discriminatory, threatening or innopropriate violates our conduct. This includes languages and gestures both online and in-person.</p>

        <h3>Post Trip Contact</h3>
        <p>Contact should end with the laundry delivery is complete, with the only exception being for returning a lost item. Unwanted contact can be seen as harassment. Any sort of attempt at communication post-service could be seen as harassment and is therefore not allowed.</p>
