          <h1 id="CGTitle">Fresh n' Clean Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests and Service of Legal Documents</h1>
          <p>
              The following guidelines are intended to inform civil litigants and criminal defendants about the legal process for seeking records from Fresh n' Clean. These are guidelines, and this information may change at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
              These guidelines apply to both non-law enforcement and law-enforcement entities alike. As we are small, we anticipate that we will be able to handle all requests. This may change in the future.
          </p>
      </div>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Fresh n' Clean and what records do we have?</h2>
      <p>
          Fresh n' Clean is a technology company that has developed apps that connect users with third-party drivers and laundromats. More details about our services are available <a href="/index.php">here</a>. We store, use, and maintain information as described in our <a href="privacyPolicy.php">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="index.php">Community Guidelines</a>.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Where does Fresh n' Clean accept service of legal documents?</h2>
      <p>
          Please send legal documents from the US, as we only provide service there.
      </p>
      <p>
          Our registered agent will accept service only if the entity served is properly named (e.g., “Fresh n' Clean”), and our agent is authorized to accept service on behalf of that entity. Our acceptance of legal process does not waive any legal objections we may have and may raise in response.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What legal process does Fresh n' Clean require before producing data to private parties?</h2>
      <p>
          We generally require a valid subpoena issued in accordance with applicable law before we can process private requests for information. We require non-law enforcement subpoenas to be served through our registered agent for service of process. Please reach out to our legal handler John McLegal at <a href="mailto:freshncleanlegal@gmail.com">freshncleanlegal@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          Our registered agent will accept service only if the entity to whom the request is directed is named correctly (e.g., “Fresh n' Clean Technologies, Inc.”), and our agent is authorized to accept service on behalf of that entity. Our acceptance of legal process does not waive any legal objections we may have and may raise in response.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What form of requests does Fresh n' Clean require, and how are requests processed?</h2>
      <p>
          We review each subpoena or data request for facial and substantive validity and will assert appropriate objections to requests that are not facially and substantively valid. Among other things, we require requests to be narrowly tailored and not overly broad, vague, or unduly burdensome.
      </p>
      <p>
          Before making a request seeking the information of a Fresh n' Clean user, you should seek the information directly through the user account. If a user no longer has an active account, they may submit a request for their information <a href="#">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          If all other attempts to obtain the information have failed, your request should include:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>A sufficiently narrow/defined time period and the specific data requested within that time period.</li>
          <li>A specific identifying reference such as the email address or phone number associated with a user's account.</li>
          <li>Your contact information (name, email address, and phone number).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          When we determine that we are required by law to disclose data, we will search for and disclose data that we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve. We require advance notice of a third party's intention to seek a production order from a court, in accordance with applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> We will not respond to emergency requests received from non-law enforcement officials. Non-law enforcement officials aware of an emergency situation should immediately contact local law enforcement.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Does Fresh n' Clean provide a certificate of authentication or expert testimony?</h2>
      <p>
          We may provide a certification from our records custodian but are generally not able to provide in-person or expert witness testimony.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What about if I'm just getting my own data and I'm not law enforcement?</h2>
      <p>
          We still require you to send legal documentation proving your identity beyond what we request for a normal account. Please look <a href="#">here</a> and fill out the form to get started.
