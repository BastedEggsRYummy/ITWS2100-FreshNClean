# Fresh n' Clean Copyright Policy

## Notification of Copyright Infringement

Fresh n' Clean respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same.

It is Fresh n' Clean’s policy, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.

In the context of our app, this can look like (but is not limited to):

1. Using only content owned and created by us at Fresh n' Clean

2. Using user generated content (UGC) given it follows the following guidelines laid out here and in our USER GENERATED CONTENT POLICY INSERT HERE

In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 and in recognition of various international copyright laws, Fresh n' Clean will respond expeditiously to notices sent to Fresh n' Clean’s Designated Copyright Agent (identified below) regarding alleged third-party copyright infringements on the Fresh n' Clean website or other Fresh n' Clean-owned and publicly accessible digital properties.

A copyright owner, person authorized to act on behalf of one, or person authorized to act under any exclusive right under copyright may submit allegations of copyright infringements on the Site(s) by completing the following DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement and delivering it to Fresh n' Clean’s Designated Copyright Agent. Upon receipt of this Notice, Fresh n' Clean will expeditiously remove or block access to the allegedly infringing content, notify the alleged third-party infringer of the same, and provide the third-party an opportunity to submit a counter-notice to dispute the alleged infringement. If a counter-notice is submitted, Fresh n' Clean will promptly forward it to the complainant and restore the removed or blocked content within 10-14 business days, unless the complainant submits evidence that it has filed a lawsuit against the alleged third-party infringer regarding the allegedly infringing content.
