Trademarks
Fresh n' Clean respects the rights of trademark owners and may assist trademark owners with the removal of infringing content. Fresh n' Clean is not an arbiter of third-party disputes and recognizes that third-parties may sometimes lawfully use trademarks owned by other parties. Accordingly, we encourage parties to an infringement dispute to communicate with each other to try to find an amicable resolution to the dispute. If you believe someone is infringing your trademark, you may submit a trademark complaint to Fresh n' Clean at the email or land address provided below; your complaint must include the following information:

Upon submission of your complaint, you will receive an automatic reply that your communication has been received. If the complaint is incomplete, you will receive a notification that identifies the missing information required for Fresh n' Clean to review the complaint. When your complaint is complete, Fresh n' Clean reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, that the complaint is without merit and, if so, to decline to take any further action. You will be notified of any such determination. Otherwise, Fresh n' Clean will forward your complaint and contact information to the allegedly infringing party, who will have 10 business days to provide a response. If no response is received within 10 business days, Fresh n' Clean may remove any allegedly infringing material or disable the allegedly infringing account. If a response is received, Fresh n' Clean will forward it to you, with a copy to the allegedly infringing party, and ask that you contact the party directly to try to amicably resolve the matter. If you and the allegedly infringing party are unable to amicably resolve the matter, Fresh n' Clean will engage third-party legal counsel to review the dispute and recommend which party to the dispute should prevail. Fresh n' Clean will inform both parties of legal counsel’s recommendation and then, absent extraordinary circumstances, take or decline to take action accordingly.
