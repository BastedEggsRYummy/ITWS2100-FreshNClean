      <h1 id="CGTitle">Fresh n' Clean Non-Discrimination Policy</h1>
      <p>
          Fresh n' Clean is committed to providing access to inclusive, reliable, and high-quality service options to everyone. Fresh n' Clean therefore prohibits discrimination against users based on race, ethnicity, skin color, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, or any other characteristic protected under U.S. law.
      </p>
      <p>
          Such discrimination includes, but is not limited to, any user refusing to provide or accept services based on any of these characteristics or rating another user based on any protected trait.
      </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="sub-heading">Discrimination on the Basis of Geographical Location</h2>
  <p>
      Discrimination on the basis of geographical location does not include a driver or delivery person declining a job that does not work for them. However, intentionally refusing or canceling requests, or using features on the Fresh n' Clean map to avoid receiving job requests, solely for the purpose of avoiding a particular neighborhood due to the characteristics of the people or businesses in that area, is not allowed.
  </p>

  <p>
      Any user found to have violated this prohibition will lose access to the Fresh n' Clean platform. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Applicable laws in certain jurisdictions may require and/or allow the provision of services by and for the benefit of a specific category of persons. In such jurisdictions, services provided in compliance with these laws and the relevant applicable terms are permissible under this policy.
