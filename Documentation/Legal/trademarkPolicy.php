          Fresh n' Clean respects the rights of trademark owners and may assist trademark owners with the removal of infringing content. Fresh n' Clean is not an arbiter of third-party disputes and recognizes that third parties may sometimes lawfully use trademarks owned by others. Accordingly, we encourage parties to an infringement dispute to communicate with each other to try to find an amicable resolution.
