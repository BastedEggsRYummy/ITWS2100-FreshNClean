Every driver or delivery person who uses the Fresh n' Clean platform has a responsibility to drive safely and follow the established rules of the road. Fresh n' Clean has a zero-tolerance policy for the use of alcohol or drugs by drivers using Fresh n' Clean’s service. If we receive reports of suspected impaired driving, the driver may lose access to their account, as stated in their agreement with Fresh n' Clean.*

## What is suspected impaired driving?
A driver or delivery person, by law, may not drive or bike while using alcohol, drugs, or any other substance that impairs their ability to safely operate a vehicle. That includes having open containers of alcohol or drugs in a vehicle while using the Fresh n' Clean app.

## What is a report of impaired driving?
A report of suspected impaired driving includes a report from any person that explicitly alleges that the driver or delivery person was using, in possession of, or appeared to be impaired by drugs or alcohol, or that the vehicle smelled like alcohol or other drugs.

## How does Fresh n' Clean handle reports of suspected impaired driving?
A report from any person who reasonably suspects the driver is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while providing rideshare services or delivery services will lead to loss of access to the service while further investigation is conducted. If investigation finds sufficient evidence that a driver violated this policy, they will permanently lose access to Fresh n' Clean’s service.

## Will a driver be affected by false user reports?
Our teams proactively review each report for signs that it might be fraudulent. We are continually implementing new processes and technology to identify and discourage user fraud. Any report that appears to be fraudulent would not affect a driver’s safety history or their status on the service. Users who submit false information to Fresh n' Clean or otherwise engage in fraudulent activity violate Fresh n' Clean’s Community Guidelines and risk losing access to the Fresh n' Clean platform.

## What can a driver do if their user is under the influence?
A driver can always decline a trip for their own safety or if it doesn't work for them (except for discriminatory reasons, as explained in our Community Guidelines). That includes instances where a user appears too drunk or rowdy, or smells strongly of drugs or alcohol.

## What can a user do if their driver is under the influence?
Drug use and open containers of alcohol are never allowed while using the Fresh n' Clean platform. If you’re a user and you have reason to believe your driver may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, ask the driver to end the trip immediately. Then exit the vehicle and call 911. After the driver has ended the trip, report your experience to Fresh n' Clean directly in the app by tapping Help from the menu and selecting your issue. You can also get in contact by visiting help.Fresh n' Clean.com or emailing customercomplaints@Fresh n' Clean.com.
