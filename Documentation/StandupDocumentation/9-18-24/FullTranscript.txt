1 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:51.297
Okay, Hello.

2 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:54.807
Can you hear me? Yeah.

3 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:00:54.807 --> 00:01:03.503
Can hear you, Awesome, well how.

4 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:15.831
How's our, how's our sprint been going? I know we haven't exactly said any sprint goals yet. Anyone do anything? No.

5 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:25.480
I know I haven't done anything yet also the transcripts so you can edit.

6 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.568
That.

7 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:30.500
Yeah.

8 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:39.183
Do we have a milestone we have to meet? Or NO? I mean.

9 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:44.526
We should set a, like a goal for the entire sprint, so.

10 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:48.847
Yeah. Maybe we.

11 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:01:48.847 --> 00:02:02.963
You can do that quickly, yeah, if you wanted to. And you want to use the the like the github stuff, right? Like the board and NO that's fine, but for the.

12 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:02:02.963 --> 00:02:11.288
But we probably should, yeah. So he can see it, but.

13 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:16.280
Is that like what like the projects page again? Yeah.

14 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.226
Oh.

15 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:19.965
Hello. Hi.

16 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:24.626
Yeah.

17 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:26.429
Okay.

18 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.408
Yeah.

19 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:02:28.408 --> 00:02:46.287
I mean I, I opened the branch for the search page kind of something. I wrote I wrote like a little bit, but it doesn't have much right now.

20 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:48.293
That's good. Is there a list.

21 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:52.349
So things that we had to do for less from meetings.

22 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.507
I think the general outline was talk about what we did and then what we're planning on doing. Yeah.

23 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:02:59.507 --> 00:03:00.529
And that's a.

24 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.521
About it. We should.

25 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:05.585
Actually make like a projects page with this.

26 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:31.462
It sounded like he wanted some sort of plan for like the current sprint or whatever. So, I don't know if we have to, if we need that by today, but like at some point we should just write down what we're trying to accomplish like this month or like I guess until October like 20th. Yes.

27 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:34.258
Like the midterm.

28 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:03:34.258 --> 00:03:37.890
The projects page right now.

29 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.829
Sure yeah we can.

30 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.743
Put items on them.

31 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:49.627
And we should also.

32 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:03:49.627 --> 00:04:02.483
Probably like create a doc with like a formal write up for like what our sprint thing is just in case he asks probably.

33 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:06.281
That should be good.

34 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:10.806
I'm Eyes the eyes though?

35 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:04:10.806 --> 00:04:13.422
I don't know which one are you using?

36 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:20.533
I'm gonna I create a project page for and then there's one that's like for future releases of.

37 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:23.662
Homework. Sure.

38 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:27.935
Yeah.

39 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.919
Okay.

40 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:30.703
This is.

41 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:44.103
No worries.

42 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:48.699
You guys can see it. Yeah this.

43 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.941
Like a roadmap well.

44 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:56.959
Sure yeah.

45 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:07.631
Jason stuff. Okay.

46 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:09.301
Okay.

47 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:10.651
Right.

48 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:15.898
That's all cool, oh.

49 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:19.312
Sorry. It's the one.

50 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:21.933
That just says visionary more types, right? Yeah.

51 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:05:21.933 --> 00:05:26.474
Yeah. Okay, ok.

52 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:32.399
I'll add some stuff to the status board, I guess. Are we have.

53 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:36.453
Giving the thing like recording our words and transcribing it.

54 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:39.534
If that's going on.

55 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:50.995
Yeah, do we.

56 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:05:50.995 --> 00:06:02.055
You want me to send in like a document just in case we want to actually write down the like September sprint?

57 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:04.810
And.

58 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.335
I mean we could just use the, the project page.

59 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:13.560
I I know I'm just saying I don't know if Callahan wants something more formal than that.

60 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.935
Oh.

61 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:18.195
I don't know either.

62 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:27.592
I think. I said.

63 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:06:27.592 --> 00:06:39.065
Into just in case, I don't think we need to like, we can just, someone can just transcribe everything that's on the like projects eventually if we really need to.

64 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:45.456
Okay, please.

65 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:52.656
It's very new.

66 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:06:52.656 --> 00:06:59.058
I'm, I'll open the proposal and add some of the stuff we had from that. Okay.

67 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:06:59.058 --> 00:07:13.672
In regards to like what we're gonna say we're doing, like, what are our priorities for this? Like or like what are we trying to say that we're gonna do this month? Really.

68 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:17.332
It's very like beginning, oh sorry. That's.

69 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:19.711
Okay, you can go. I was just thinking this is like.

70 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:07:19.711 --> 00:07:26.939
We're beginning the sprint now, we're like setting goals.

71 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:33.395
In terms of the project, I think we should at least just build the HTML and CSS. Yeah.

72 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:36.857
Okay, so we should just have like a basic front end, doesn't have to.

73 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:39.289
Ever polished.

74 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:40.856
Yeah.

75 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:41.932
Yeah.

76 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:44.856
We have the Figma ready so we already have like basically.

77 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:54.674
I'll put basic wire frames down as in the like backlog, yeah.

78 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.556
Uh.

79 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:07:56.556 --> 00:08:09.622
Do we want, ok, I'm trying to think like what else, do we want so I can set up the database in terms of like cause I know we wanted to make accounts and history and stuff.

80 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:15.005
I don't.

81 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:16.983
It's like how we did in intro? Yeah.

82 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:08:16.983 --> 00:08:36.142
I would just set it up like that. I'd create an account, like the user info thing and then I'd probably create a history database or like that's attached to the users and then you would just join them with SQL.

83 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:08:36.142 --> 00:08:51.286
And, I'm.

84 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:55.704
Sure, is there a proposal in the group repo? Yes.

85 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:08:55.704 --> 00:09:03.648
It is. Okay. Yeah.

86 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:09:03.648 --> 00:09:15.926
One month, oh.

87 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:25.027
Oh, oh wait, never mind, this is not for this.

88 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:26.310
I'm sorry.

89 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.086
Ready are you saying that like that stuff we're doing right now?

90 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:54.906
Right, yeah, pretty much. Okay. I guess if, it's kind of redundant, by.

91 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:59.303
Search page, what do you mean by that?

92 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:09:59.303 --> 00:10:18.449
I'm, I think the pay the visuals and functionality, but I guess in a, you know, I'll make more clean layout.

93 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:52.844
Okay, I.

94 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:10:52.844 --> 00:10:59.811
All of the pages that we have in Figma like all the ones that we want or are there more?

95 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:10:59.811 --> 00:11:09.308
Let me think. So we want the homepage obviously. We want to log in and create account.

96 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:11:09.308 --> 00:11:14.107
We probably want to create a profile page, I'd assume. Okay.

97 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:15.229
Yeah.

98 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:18.647
On that profile page, you'd probably just have like a button to do.

99 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:36.435
Display the history, so I don't think you need a separate history page. Yeah. So home, schedule, create login, profile.

100 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:11:36.435 --> 00:11:41.011
The schedule is part of the search page, I thought. Why.

101 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:43.685
What is the search page? Yeah, what is the search page?

102 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:51.118
So it's like we have the, the page with the two buttons like schedule now. Okay.

103 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:11:51.118 --> 00:11:53.535
It's another scheduled page.

104 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:11:53.535 --> 00:11:56.691
That that it that does make more sense, calling it that.

105 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:11:56.691 --> 00:11:58.450
Oh, so you were just saying.

106 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.414
That's what it is like the word for schedule of.

107 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:12:00.414 --> 00:12:11.735
Okay. Yeah, like searchings a better term to clear that up. So when you said search, I thought you were saying like a search bar or something. Yeah. I mean.

108 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:12:11.735 --> 00:12:14.950
I don't know what that would do.

109 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.915
That's why I was very confused.

110 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:12:16.915 --> 00:12:25.854
Okay, delete that. Oh.

111 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:12:25.854 --> 00:12:31.614
Okay.

112 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:12:31.614 --> 00:12:32.516
Yeah.

113 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:41.157
I can make, like a Figma wireframe for the profile page. Yeah.

114 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:50.797
Yeah, you can just do, we can put down like wireframe, like remaining wireframes as something we have to do. Yeah.

115 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:12:50.797 --> 00:12:58.437
Okay, what's basic wireframe supposed to be? No hold on.

116 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:12:58.437 --> 00:13:17.576
I was saying more so like the basic page, like the pages don't have to be like the perfect look. It just have to have like the functionality so you can test like it doesn't need to be final look. I was just saying like, there's some code into it.

117 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:13:17.576 --> 00:13:21.516
Okay, but.

118 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:22.754
But I.

119 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:13:22.754 --> 00:13:29.574
Could change that to something else.

120 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:13:29.574 --> 00:13:32.398
Maybe like basic website layout or something? Yeah.

121 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:37.896
Yeah, I'll just write basic page functionality.

122 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:43.175
Yeah.

123 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:13:43.175 --> 00:13:46.475
What is the difference between backlog and ready?

124 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:13:46.475 --> 00:13:54.117
A backlog means that it hasn't been started yet. Ready means that like that's something we're going to be, that we're currently working on.

125 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:13:54.117 --> 00:13:55.077
Yeah.

126 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:13:55.077 --> 00:13:59.395
And then in progress is like, oh, I thought.

127 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:04.710
Ready means that like we can start it right now in progress means.

128 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.216
Currently working, but.

129 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:14:06.216 --> 00:14:14.800
Backlog means like that's something that needs to be done. Or like backlog means that you need to do other stuff before you can start. Okay.

130 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.195
I'll also.

131 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:21.752
Change the database setup to ready because I can just do that whenever. Yeah.

132 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:14:21.752 --> 00:14:24.936
Okay.

133 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:33.813
Oh, uh.

134 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:42.931
I can, oh, I can like create the login and create account pages.

135 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:57.089
Yeah, I was gonna say in terms of like assigning work, do, like, do some people have certain preferences? Like, does someone not wanna work with PHP really badly? Does someone, like, that kind of stuff?

136 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:01.823
I really do not know much PHP, but I mean I kind of want to learn. Okay.

137 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:15:01.823 --> 00:15:27.299
Yeah, that's. I was gonna say that like I'll like I'm not the best with it, but my term projects last semester or like last year was basically all PHP in terms of like database stuff. So I would be fine doing that again if people wanted me to, but I'm I'm open to I'm flexible I can take whatever spot people want me to.

138 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:32.573
Okay.

139 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:15:32.573 --> 00:15:36.353
I like help with some of the PHP stuff but like can someone like yeah.

140 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:49.012
Yeah. I can I can do the main and I'll just like, if I want something smaller or like help with something else I can for sure ask.

141 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:15:49.012 --> 00:15:55.636
We can use the live share thing if we're both trying to work. Oh.

142 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:15:55.636 --> 00:15:57.374
And then on the on the commit I.

143 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:16.474
I would just because commit you can like write contributors like I don't think it would necessarily add to like number of lines committed to you, but I could cite you on the like commit or like you could cite me, e.g. and just attach each other. Okay.

144 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:16:16.474 --> 00:16:23.731
Yeah.

145 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:16:23.731 --> 00:16:24.754
S.

146 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:16:24.754 --> 00:16:33.172
Is this all stuff that we're like to finish by the for the 1st sprint or are we doing like total stuff at all? Like, I.

147 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:16:33.172 --> 00:16:57.436
I think that right now we should just focus on the 1st sprint and I'm assuming the 1st sprint is just we want like the basic look of the website with basic functionality. We don't need to go like deep into like cause I don't know if we're trying to like display how far the person picking up the laundry is, like cause that would probably require a lot of live communication. Yeah.

148 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:16:57.436 --> 00:16:59.472
Yeah.

149 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:16:59.472 --> 00:17:11.605
And that like I was trying to figure it that out, thinking about it logistically, that's a little bit hard, at least how I'm thinking about it.

150 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:13.621
But.

151 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:19.185
But it's not something that's impossible for us to do.

152 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:22.221
Sure.

153 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:41.959
So, like, that would be something that I'd say would be like saved until like one of the later sprints because that's not like a, it is like a functionality thing, but you could instead just have it be like, when the person's there, they sit like they click the, their, their button and it sends a push notification.

154 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:17:41.959 --> 00:18:00.546
Location instead to the website and thus you don't need to see the actual location of the person. Maybe until like they did, like, maybe it'll take the position when they press that button and then send it over instead of like constant live tracking.

155 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:07.052
But like that's a later, that's why I'm saying that would probably be like the.

156 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:12.990
Last sprint kind of thing where it's like additional nicer touches.

157 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:28.831
Yeah, someone want to like, like create like a, like a theme or something like, like, is everybody like good at like making it look good? That's it.

158 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:29.927
Good point.

159 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:18:29.927 --> 00:18:42.008
They kind of just stole for the like 1st lab like that color palette off of a website. I, I will forfeit that I'm not doing that.

160 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:18:42.008 --> 00:18:47.939
So.

161 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:54.850
Well, the figmas should theoretically like provide the coloring.

162 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:55.907
Sure. So.

163 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:18:55.907 --> 00:19:21.263
So like I would I'm not saying that the person who does the figmas should necessarily do the CSS styling if like, either they don't want to or don't think they can make like replicate the look. But like the coloring and styling of how the website should look should likely come from the figmas, and then the CSS is just trying to replicate that.

164 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:19:21.263 --> 00:19:25.844
Yeah.

165 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:19:25.844 --> 00:19:30.047
I think we have a pretty good set of stuff to do for at least till next Saturday.

166 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:19:30.047 --> 00:19:31.981
For this Saturday.

167 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:33.561
Yeah.

168 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:19:33.561 --> 00:19:41.644
Is there anything else anybody really wants to say before, I mean, we've been here for like 15 min at this point, so.

169 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:19:41.644 --> 00:19:52.563
Oh, I don't think so. I think it's just, I don't think we need to get a monumental amount of work done. I think it's just piece by piece because I know everyone has classes.

170 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:19:52.563 --> 00:19:53.905
Yeah, I agree.

171 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:55.544
Get started.

172 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:19:55.544 --> 00:20:07.815
It as like and we don't I don't think by end of semester, Calluhan is expecting us to have like because I don't want to say that our group probably has one of the hardest projects, but.

173 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:20:07.815 --> 00:20:09.365
In terms of concept.

174 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:20:09.365 --> 00:20:22.260
That's like the functionality that our website needs is a lot more than like the planners and sca like that kind of thing that the other groups are doing.

175 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.863
Yeah, screen demanding. Yeah.

176 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:20:23.863 --> 00:20:31.604
Especially in regards to like needing like live communication between two parties on a website.

177 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:20:31.604 --> 00:20:42.480
I mean we can put in webhooks. I don't really want to. I don't even know how to do that.

178 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:50.262
I mean if Callahan said that we needed to find something that we didn't think we could do.

179 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:20:50.262 --> 00:20:55.804
That's true. We'll cross that bridge when we get there. Yeah.

180 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:20:55.804 --> 00:21:00.442
Yeah, but I I think this is a pretty good set of things.

181 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:21:00.442 --> 00:21:02.583
And people.

182 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:21:02.583 --> 00:21:14.323
Those should just tackle it as it goes. I can, well Harry, you said that you wanted to do the, like, login and create account pages or?

183 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:21:14.323 --> 00:21:23.223
Yeah, like, I can do like the HTML like in JavaScript and CS or I guess CSS would like once I once that.

184 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:21:23.223 --> 00:21:40.938
Yeah, if you want me to do like the PHP connecting the form, I can do that. Like you can set up the form with JS and all that stuff. I can connect it to the database and because I'll have built the database. And I could build it off of that.

185 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:21:40.938 --> 00:21:48.963
Wait so are we all working on, who's working on like the basic page layouts?

186 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:21:48.963 --> 00:21:55.424
That's what I was gonna say. We did need to split, like, say who's doing what.

187 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:21:55.424 --> 00:21:58.505
Okay, yeah, I think we should decide that right now. Yeah, I mean.

188 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:21:58.505 --> 00:22:03.043
There's like a, there's an assignee's part on of the projects.

189 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:22:03.043 --> 00:22:06.339
Yeah, I can see just.

190 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:12.057
So you, the arrow down, you click on that and you can put yourself or.

191 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:22:12.057 --> 00:22:13.997
Many of us?

192 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:22:13.997 --> 00:22:18.145
The arrow down.

193 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:22:18.145 --> 00:22:20.699
Wait, I don't know how to do that. Okay, yeah.

194 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:30.365
Like, like I Do you see that I just put you down for the login page, Mary?

195 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:22:30.365 --> 00:22:32.582
Oh yeah, I do.

196 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:22:32.582 --> 00:22:56.663
Do you not see the little arrow on the right of that box? No. Sorry. Wait, I'll send a screenshot on discard, like the, you don't see the arrow to the left of like the blue.

197 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:22:56.663 --> 00:22:57.703
Okay.

198 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:22:57.703 --> 00:22:59.166
No.

199 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:22:59.166 --> 00:23:03.965
Oh, he's in the back, the, the 1st tab, the prioritized back.

200 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:05.456
Look.

201 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:23:05.456 --> 00:23:15.043
Oh, oh yeah, where he goes. Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah, you're you have to edit it in the backlog.

202 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:23:15.043 --> 00:23:16.063
Oh, ok. Sorry, my.

203 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:22.020
That I should have specified.

204 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.200
Okay.

205 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.707
Okay.

206 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:23:25.707 --> 00:23:27.327
So.

207 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:23:27.327 --> 00:23:47.043
I will help with the database part of that so I'll put myself onto it. There you go. I can do the profile page cause that will be taking a lot of stuff from the database.

208 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:23:49.286 --> 00:24:04.415
I don't necessarily know what it'll look like, but I can get the functionality of like grabbing the things we need ready and then the display I can do when someone thinks of what it'll look like or stuff.

209 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:07.913
Yeah.

210 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:14.261
Right.

211 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:24:14.261 --> 00:24:17.260
Anyway.

212 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:31.122
And I I don't think we, like everyone can just assign themselves to whatever they want to do. And if there's like not people to certain things we can either spread out or all pick up what people don't want.

213 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:24:31.704 --> 00:24:36.874
Yeah, I'll take whichever page isn't done.

214 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:24:36.874 --> 00:25:01.608
Yeah, oh yeah, someone could be like writing the like about us page information, like, we have other stuff that's not coding that could be done like the writing of the about us, or like someone like writing about the process of like how we want it to work in terms of scheduling something.

215 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:03.533
Some documentation stuff, yeah.

216 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:25:03.533 --> 00:25:16.711
Yeah exactly, because there is the the development part, but we also, there should probably be a centralized guideline so people know like how we want the website to flow and function.

217 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:23.287
I have a question.

218 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:25:23.287 --> 00:25:25.184
In terms of service.

219 "Ruan, Amanda" (1103669760)
00:25:25.184 --> 00:25:28.012
Okay. That's, I'm assuming.

220 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:25:28.012 --> 00:25:31.093
But, uh.

221 "Krushel, Cole" (2616253440)
00:25:31.093 --> 00:25:32.431
Kelly hand was.

222 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:42.532
Yeah, that's what Callianne wants and sounds like what Jackson is interested in doing. Oh.

223 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:25:42.532 --> 00:25:46.287
Okay.

224 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:25:46.287 --> 00:25:47.048
Sh.

225 "Hargreaves, Harry" (799928832)
00:25:47.048 --> 00:25:49.709
Where is ok.

226 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:25:49.709 --> 00:26:04.274
I think we're, I don't know, it's up to you guys, but I think we're pretty good for now and people can just assign, and if they think of anything else, just drop it on the like project board and we can move things around.

227 "Yau, Caitlin" (1413769216)
00:26:04.274 --> 00:26:08.270
Also, I, I filled out the doc, the Google Doc with.

228 "Voynovich, Matthew" (1590160128)
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.507
Sick.

229 "Baimel, Jackson" (2601033216)
00:26:11.507 --> 00:26:15.252
