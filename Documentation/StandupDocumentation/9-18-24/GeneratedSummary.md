# Summary

The team discussed setting sprint goals, tracking progress on GitHub, and assigning tasks for creating front-end functionality and layout with a focus on live communication.

The team needs to set sprint goals and establish a milestone for the entire sprint.

They plan to use the projects page on GitHub to track progress and set up a formal write-up for the sprint.

The main focus of the first sprint is to create basic front-end functionality and layout based on Figma wireframes.

The group has a good set of tasks to work on until next Saturday, with a focus on piece by piece progress.

Their project requires more functionality compared to other groups, especially in terms of live communication on the website.

The team needs to assign specific tasks and responsibilities for each member and consider non-coding tasks like documentation and writing.
