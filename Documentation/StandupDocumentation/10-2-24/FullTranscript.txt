You said discussed the answers.

105 "Krushel, Cole" (237999360)
00:19:51.172 --> 00:20:05.847
I can learn yourself. I like, well what did what did you guys like about this sprint? What was your favorite part?

106 "Hargreaves, Harry" (4117460736)
00:20:05.847 --> 00:20:14.690
I kind of liked using scrumb. I thought it was that it like can be more accountable than I definitely than I definitely like probably would have been.

107 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2590735104)
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:23.971
Yeah, I agree with that. Having to like, if I didn't do anything and I heard everyone else do something, I'd feel like bad.

108 "Krushel, Cole" (237999360)
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:24.996
Yeah.

109 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2590735104)
00:20:24.996 --> 00:20:36.327
I feel like in Plaqua it was like I would just save everything till like the last week and do it cause none of my group members would like do anything either till the last minute.

110 "Krushel, Cole" (237999360)
00:20:36.327 --> 00:20:47.688
Yeah, it's pretty nice, even if it is a painting before. It's just like.

111 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2590735104)
00:20:47.688 --> 00:20:55.472
I don't know what's going on. Are we still supposed to be doing stuff with this guy or?

112 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2590735104)
00:20:57.291 --> 00:21:07.912
At a certain point I'm gonna have to leave, not now, but this one.

113 "Ruan, Amanda" (1273070080)
00:21:07.912 --> 00:21:13.191
Okay.

114 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2590735104)
00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:14.631
Okay.

115 "Hargreaves, Harry" (4117460736)
00:21:14.631 --> 00:21:33.964

00:21:52.408 --> 00:21:59.149
Okay.

117 "Ruan, Amanda" (1273070080)
00:21:59.149 --> 00:22:01.167
Okay.

118 "Krushel, Cole" (237999360)
00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:07.948
I mean that's probably everything.

119 "Hargreaves, Harry" (4117460736)
00:22:07.948 --> 00:22:12.367
Yourself this recording and play anywhere?

120 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2590735104)
00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:16.688

121 "Baimel, Jackson" (2604712960)
00:22:16.688 --> 00:22:25.702
I mean I can take the recording, do whatever I do with it, plus the stuff in the discord server and upload that to the github, like the stand up documentation like.

122 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2590735104)
00:22:25.702 --> 00:22:34.375
Yeah, do we like something and ask if we have more or?

123 "Baimel, Jackson" (2604712960)

Okay, uh.

128 "Krushel, Cole" (237999360)
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:06.895
