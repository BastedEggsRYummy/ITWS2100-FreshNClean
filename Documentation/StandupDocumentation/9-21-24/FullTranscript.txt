00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.167

Yeah.

9 "Voynovich, Matthew" (4077600256)
00:01:41.125 --> 00:02:07.670
I guess we can just make this quick and just say either like just the intended meeting compared to like setting up our thing like last time, we can just say what we're intending to do and if we've worked on anything so far currently And I guess we can just go down unless people have more to say for this meeting.

10 "Voynovich, Matthew" (4077600256)
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.830
Okay.

11 "Baimel, Jackson" (4169642240)
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.087
I don't think that's a great idea. Alright.

12 "Voynovich, Matthew" (4077600256)
00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:42.024
I can start and we can just go down line. I'm currently using the local host thing that I was showing in class to just set up the database with like the mysql stuff and I'm like just trying to get some forms working with PHP, and then I haven't like designed the interface for those pages yet, just trying to connect the forms with the setup database.

13 "Krushel, Cole" (110619392)
00:02:42.024 --> 00:03:02.324
Yeah, I made like a s a skeleton for the search page and I wanted to try implementing the Google the geolocation and the Google Maps API. Although I might need someone else to create a key because my free trial is over.

14 "Voynovich, Matthew" (4077600256)
00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:05.742

Okay.

17 "Hargreaves, Harry" (2365752320)
00:03:12.144 --> 00:03:42.122
Also what we're planning yeah sorry I can go next, I guess. So I created the like HTML and JavaScript for the create account and the login pages, and I'm just waiting for like the, I I guess I still need to do that, like connected with the PHP and like the data and the like database stuff.

18 "Voynovich, Matthew" (4077600256)
00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:45.525
Yeah, once I set that up on the actual VM cause I've only done it on local.

19 "Hargreaves, Harry" (2365752320)
00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.623

Yeah, I guess.

30 "Hargreaves, Harry" (2365752320)
00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:42.604
I guess I can add CSS to those two pages and I can actually, I'll look at the projects page but it what doesn't taken or I guess I guess we can go back to this because my take is like.

31 "Hargreaves, Harry" (2365752320)
00:04:42.604 --> 00:04:48.684
I just I just choose something from the, from the projects page.

32 "Krushel, Cole" (110619392)
00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:53.602
Sure.

33 "Ruan, Amanda" (578597632)
00:04:53.602 --> 00:05:16.042
I will go next. I worked on the Figma for the profile page and I think that's all the wireframes that we need. So I haven't started the about us page yet, but I'll do that sometime next weekend.

34 "Yau, Caitlin" (2685351168)
00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:17.361

Yeah.

36 "Baimel, Jackson" (4169642240)
00:05:19.046 --> 00:05:47.689
For me, this past week, I I recorded the the meeting and then I uploaded that. I sent in a pull request for adding that to the data to the github. I also added a documentation folder for that to go in so there would be a documentation folder, then that there's a stand UPS folder and then I have all the stuff from this. I split into two different files. There's a markdown folder where I put the summary that.

37 "Baimel, Jackson" (4169642240)
00:05:47.689 --> 00:06:19.183
That Webex generates plus the, there's like highlights that it creates like timestamps, and then there's a 2nd file where it just dumps the entire transcripts, which is just again taken from the recording. This meeting's being recorded as well the same thing again, and then I didn't do anything with the terms of service or anything. That's the plan for next week for me. Sounds good.

38 "Yau, Caitlin" (2685351168)
00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:34.465
And for me, I worked on the homepage, so I'm doing the HTML and CSS at the same time, so I already did about like half of the homepage and I'll finish it for next time.
