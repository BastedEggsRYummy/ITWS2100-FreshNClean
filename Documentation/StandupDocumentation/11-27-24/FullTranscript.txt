2 "Ruan, Amanda" (3296609280)
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.723
Oh, I don't see anything.

3 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:24.861
Oh, ok. My thing is very slow right now.

4 "Ruan, Amanda" (3296609280)
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:40.576
Very good. I see it now.

5 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:00:46.140 --> 00:01:18.081
Let me try, this is not loading. Let me try to switch rooms there real quick.

6 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:01:55.042 --> 00:02:30.136
Hello? Okay, well, it's not letting me open anything, but, on the page like underneath the, the like the form, there's like an X then like you can like exit out, but it like doesn't it's like not attached to anything.

7 "Ruan, Amanda" (3296609280)
00:02:30.136 --> 00:02:34.374
That's weird, ok. I'll go look into that.

8 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:02:34.374 --> 00:02:45.697
And I was also trying to show like I tried to change the CSS, but I mean it's not letting. I'll try to send like a screenshot or something if it.

9 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:48.053
Cause it's not letting right now.

10 "Ruan, Amanda" (3296609280)
00:02:48.053 --> 00:03:02.212
Yeah, about that X thing, like it happened to me too, but like when I tried like I opened it in like a private window and it just like disappeared. So I don't know if it's because like the CSS didn't refresh or something, but.

11 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:03:02.212 --> 00:03:04.096
Oh. Yeah.

12 "Ruan, Amanda" (3296609280)
00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:07.552
No, I'll look into it though. Okay.

13 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:38.135
I've been trying to change the CSS. I'm trying to I wanted to see what you guys thought before I do it to all the pages, but I did to the header in the footer like the the homepage, I'll send a screenshot cause it's not letting me share right now, but once it loaded I'll submit and then I guess if you guys like it, I'll continue like for the other pages and if not, then I'll like switch it up.

14 "Ruan, Amanda" (3296609280)
00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:39.992
Okay, sounds good.

15 "Ruan, Amanda" (3296609280)
00:03:49.653 --> 00:04:09.154
I guess for what I did, I did the for the laundry instructions that Cole wanted me to do, and then I'm gonna work on the environment variables like sometime of a break and get that done.

16 "Yau, Caitlin" (1969944320)
00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:26.431
I have an idea for redesigning the home page because I don't think the home page is layout is that good, but is there anything else that we need to do before our presentation?

17 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:31.235
Should we make like a, like an actual like like presentation like the.

00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:42.876
PowerPoint. What are doing, are we doing we're not doing like a script, right? We're just like we should probably practice though.

20 "Yau, Caitlin" (1969944320)
00:04:42.876 --> 00:04:47.810
No script but should at least like discuss like what we're gonna talk about for each slide.

21 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.672
Can we have like the notes in like the PowerPoint, like the bullets?

Okay, is there what else needs to be done for that Presentation like PowerPoint and like practicing then Do we wanna do like the oh then we can do well let's continue like coding after, right? So it doesn't need to be like completely finished, but it has to be like good enough to present, right?

00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:42.247
Yeah.

28 "Hargreaves, Harry" (421392896)
00:05:42.247 --> 00:05:59.759
