1 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:12.622
Yeah, should we like start the meeting since NO one.

2 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:16.042
Else has been showing up? Yeah.

3 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:39.321
I think we should just get started. Okay, sure. I've worked, I've almost finished most of the stuff from, like scrum/sprint one. I haven't fully finished it, which is why I haven't pushed stuff yet, but I'll have that done for sure this weekend, like guaranteed and then I'll start working on the other stuff.

4 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:44.279
Yeah, Sounds good. Is there.

5 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:49.235
Is there anything I should help with with for that? Did you do.

6 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:51.859
Is the styling for your login form yet? Yeah.

7 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:11:51.859 --> 00:12:01.500
Good, it should be pushed, does it not? Yeah, NO, I I didn't check it, that's all. Okay, I'll just copy your styling over to the, like.

8 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.580
Performant and create a.

9 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:20.719
Now. Oh, I already did that. Oh, you did it? Sick. Okay. I'll look at all that then. I I'm just reworking the tables so I separate the, like, other accounts and I was look I was looking in more about the session data and playing around with.

10 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:35.643
That. So, that's all I've been doing. But otherwise, I should be done with everything from sprint one this week and then I can start working on whatever we need me to be doing.

11 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:12:35.643 --> 00:12:51.779
So yeah, I did the, some more styling and like just issue off, but then I had a question, what is, so for documentation, like what, what does that include? Like.

12 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:55.419
Is that like how like to use the website? Right.

13 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:12:55.419 --> 00:13:04.122
Yeah sorry. We have in like the in the projects page, the, like, start creating documentation.

14 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:13:04.122 --> 00:13:18.358
Like wow, what what does that like include? I thought that that included how to use the website and then I'd assume a little bit of that documentation stuff was like the legal stuff that.

15 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:13:18.358 --> 00:13:28.200
Jackson was supposed to be working on? Yeah, yeah. I have a separate folder right now when I push that I can move it into the documentation folder just to have a viewer.

16 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:39.138
Guys but yeah that's yeah. Okay. We should probably start a read me for like how to actually use the website. I can add like how to set up the database.

17 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:42.022
So.

18 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:45.477
Oh, the same way that like Flaka asked us to last.

19 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:13:45.477 --> 00:13:52.579
You're Wait so then what how wait, how to use the, you have to include how to set up the.

20 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:13:52.579 --> 00:14:25.057
The basis for the documentation. I I can do that. I I'm just saying that we should probably have a read me in the base level directory so that on the github it shows up and it'll be like obviously for specific directions right now because it's not a finished product, but it would be directions on how to use it, and I'll probably put in like a resources folder the SQL file for creating the databases and tables, and I'll just explain what those tables are and like.

21 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:14:25.057 --> 00:14:47.429
Okay, so I guess I can, I can start the documentation. So, ok, yeah, I know you mean that. And then also I can do the email and then that also would go in the, and like that contact us so like if I don't know if anybody started that, I don't think that's here, but I can like do.

22 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:52.329
The email and the contact us page. Alright, that sounds good.

23 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:14:52.329 --> 00:15:14.789
Yeah, for for my portion, I I did another round of the, what is it, the stand up documentation, so got big shakes there. I also need a whole bunch of the legal stuff. I haven't I'm in the same boat as Matthew where it's like just a giant blob of like documents and I haven't pushed it yet, but.

24 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:30.449
One of the things I did come across that we're definitely gonna have to do and that is good and answers a lot of our questions is we're gonna have to create some sort of a general community guidelines, which is in the legal section, but it's like a more low key general.

25 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:15:30.449 --> 00:16:02.612
Document and this one that Uber eats have or Uber has covers a lot of the questions that we were gonna be asked in our original presentation. So, that'll be good. There's also a lot of little ones that I think could be easy to go, to throw together and add on there. Like there's one here about like consumer health data privacy, like data stuff, there's individual things we decide to use cookies or incorporate like feedback or even have space for.

26 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:04.394
Guys which we're probably not gonna do, but it's all.

27 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:35.853
There, yeah. The big thing though is the community guidelines because that is, that answers a lot of logistical questions as well and one specific thing I wanna add that they have at the very bottom of their document is quote, drivers and delivery people are not agents, actual accessible or otherwise or employees of uber. They are independent 3rd party providers, which I think we should do as well. The drivers are not employees.

28 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:16:35.853 --> 00:16:39.854
Is their contractors, right? Which changes how we treat.

29 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:16:39.854 --> 00:17:07.970
Them and how we interact with them. So, yeah, a lot of cool stuff there. I'll make sure to push that. That should be done by the end of this weekend. Most of it is already there. I just finished up going through some of the other ones cause there's a shit a ton of thumbs to go through. So, that is. Amanda I know you just got here. Do you wanna say anything or are you just like.

30 "Ruan, Amanda" (634384384)
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:16.971
You're good. I'm good. I haven't gotten much done this week, so I'll try to get some work in.

31 "Baimel, Jackson" (1295908864)
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:24.551
Time this weekend. Cool, awesome. I guess we're.

32 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:17:24.551 --> 00:17:48.592
Pretty much good then? I think so. I'll text if I have any questions about anything else. I'll definitely have my stuff done this weekend, but or like the sprint one stuff this weekend completely finished off, but other than that, I think we're all.

33 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3829802496)
00:17:48.592 --> 00:17:57.813
In a decent place. Yeah, totally agree. Okay, well, sounds good.

34 "Voynovich, Matthew" (2917259520)
00:17:57.813 --> 00:17:59.875
Alright, see you guys.

35 "Ruan, Amanda" (634384384)
00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:09.396
Yeah, see it? Yep. Bye. Bye.
