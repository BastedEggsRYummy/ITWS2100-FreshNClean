00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:47.310
Hey guys, I kind of have the, their meeting in my couple minutes and I was wondering if I could just like say what I like did like before like and then like even though not everyone's here. Yeah, that's.

2 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:02:47.310 --> 00:03:03.630
Okay, so, I was working on like the PHP or like the session data and then I think I did it wrong like last week so I had to go back and like fix everything and.

3 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:19.350
I did that and then I also need to like change all the HTML files pretty much that we have except for like the header and footer and like some of the resources and just make them PHP, but not gonna change any of that.

4 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:34.860
Like functionality on that and then also I guess in the next week I can start looking at like the security like some like environmental variables or.

5 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:51.757
Or, well, like, do you guys have any suggestions for that like the user? I think we already have the user, it's right but I can start looking at security stuff alone.

6 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:54.322
What to do.

7 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:03:54.322 --> 00:03:56.563
What did you say?

8 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:03:56.563 --> 00:03:59.700
Sorry, asking like suggestions on what to do or?

9 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.440
Yeah, NO, like, and like for security.

10 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.655
Pretty like to use the environmental variables like to have like the.

11 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:13.262
Like API keys and like their username and password because like we're using that on a lot of the pages, like just to log in.

12 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:04:13.262 --> 00:04:31.596
Yeah, I mean if we already have if we're hashing the like user info where I can put in the environment I can't really think anything else.

13 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:32.459
Training.

14 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:55.219
Okay, I guess I can try to find something. I'll look at the, the, like project page and I'll like work through and see what we haven't done yet that we send me two.

15 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:01.197
All right.

16 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:04.561
No. Okay I'm just gonna say.

17 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:24.449
Still, I still have like buttons now, but like once a user has an active trip, they can return to the schedule page and it displays their active trip and on a map, that that's promotion done, but that's I mean, that doesn't look very good right now.

18 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:44.449
If if if anyone doesn't like doesn't know what they can do, like if someone can make like a figma for the schedule page or something, talk about that later because it looks not shitty right now.

19 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.377
I'm working on that.

20 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:05:50.743 --> 00:06:05.139
Don't we wait, don't we have like a figma for that or do you want like another one? Do we, do we have one? I feel like we did.

21 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.079
I'm not really sure about the find the figmas.

22 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:12.777
I could send the link again.

23 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:25.378
You do have it, we shouldn't.

24 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:06:25.378 --> 00:06:30.139
Okay, I kind of have to go. That's fine.

25 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.579
Hello there.

26 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3361632000)
00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:34.258
Alright, see you guys.

27 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:06:34.258 --> 00:06:35.102
Okay.

28 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:06:35.102 --> 00:06:40.975
Yeah, the same.

29 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:06:40.975 --> 00:07:03.089
Really quickly oh sorry I'll just so I was just writing some of the follower documents, but they're in progress, the Figma thought.

30 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:30.796
Let's like it's there.

31 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:35.538
All right, Paul, did you want like a more detailed one or?

32 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:53.339
Yeah, I was looking at the the figma. I realized it should have been clear so like that's like kind of what I have right now, but it's like, I guess I can I'm gonna show it right now.

33 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:07:53.339 --> 00:08:11.830
It's like when you schedule schedule a trip. Yeah, let me share my screen.

34 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.475
Okay.

35 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:20.939
Yeah.

36 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:22.596
Yeah.

37 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:08:22.596 --> 00:08:30.470
Now I have like an user, I have like an active trip, right? So it'll it like shows it on the map.

38 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.453
Yep.

39 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:54.698
It's still working on like the displaying the row on the map. It's upposed to like display the driver info here but it's kind of placeholder supposed to be the image so not really sure it's like it's like the status status text, I don't know, it might be like a better way to display that, but also only on the provider being.

40 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:08:54.698 --> 00:08:57.737
So.

41 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:14.895
It's not that the user here and then there's like a couple of like asher buttons which are supposed to either like cancel a trip or like go on to the next step of the like the laundry process.

42 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:17.838
Yeah.

43 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:09:17.838 --> 00:09:23.655
Okay. I means did the same thing.

44 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:09:23.655 --> 00:09:25.154
Is it.

45 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:09:25.154 --> 00:09:27.276
Buttons.

46 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:37.016
Okay, so so like you just want to more fleshed out like wire frame for those pages.

47 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:42.559
Yeah, it's like I mean it's like either I run like the vertical view.

48 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:47.992
Doing just have like map status inside.

49 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:09:47.992 --> 00:09:57.232
So or something because it's only the web browser anyways, kind of like horizontal thing design might be better. It's like how the Figma.

50 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:11.939
It's like another thing that has like the schedule of the calendar, it's like a pop up, but there's like the map, and right now the map is just like by itself.

51 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:26.668
Yeah, I think, I think a horizontal would be better. I could update the Figma to have those pages, so you could have like a reference.

52 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:40.046
Yeah, just that if you if we're looking for something to do that that's like the last thing.

53 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:49.263
Yeah, I'm still working on like the contact one thing so when I'm done with that, I'll come.

54 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:10:49.263 --> 00:10:51.208
And this one?

55 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:55.625
Yeah, like submit.

56 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.706
But it doesn't actually send the email?

57 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:08.046
Yeah, I didn't push my changes yet, but it submits and it doesn't send the email because like Gmail like filters it out.

58 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:11:08.046 --> 00:11:13.561
Or something? Yeah, I don't know if that's something we can like even do or have to do honestly.

59 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:30.993
Yeah, I don't know. I'm trying like PHP mailer to see if that will fix it, but if not, I might just revert back to like displaying the email and having them use like actual Gmail and like emails or.

60 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:11:30.993 --> 00:11:41.276
Yeah, I mean worst case we just put this as like a table in the database I guess. Just to like make it, it's like showing that we received.

61 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:11:41.276 --> 00:11:42.873
I mean.

62 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:50.651
I don't know if the email integration, I mean if you get it to work, that would be amazing because it seems kind of difficult.

63 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:11:50.651 --> 00:12:06.248
Yeah, I'm gonna try and we'll see how it goes. Yeah.

64 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:12:06.248 --> 00:12:10.750
Okay.

65 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.976
Alright, is there anything else?

66 "Baimel, Jackson" (1220648704)
00:12:13.976 --> 00:12:22.467
What? Nine.

67 "Ruan, Amanda" (1365807360)
00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:37.040
Okay, I don't think the other two can't make it, so I think that's it for today.

68 "Krushel, Cole" (123408128)
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:49.716
Yeah, I think very good. Bye bye.
