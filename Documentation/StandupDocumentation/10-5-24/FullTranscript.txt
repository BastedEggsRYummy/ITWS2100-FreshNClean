1 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:40.886
Yeah, do we wanna just start talking?

2 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:59.662
Yeah, I don't know if he's gonna come at all.

3 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:08:59.662 --> 00:09:03.222
Yeah.

4 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:09:03.222 --> 00:09:12.181
We'll have to create a new project backlog for we might have to do that. We might have to do that.

5 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:09:15.444 --> 00:09:20.240
I kind of have to go soon so I don't know if I can like do it right now but Yeah I was gonna say I don't know about.

6 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.900
Doing it right now. I still need to do comp work homework.

7 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.480
Yeah.

8 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:35.857
I feel like we have some of it. Yeah, we have some of it currently, but I I can I'm sure we can add to it all on our own at some point. Like we.

9 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:09:35.857 --> 00:09:40.761
What we want to do for this month. Yeah, we also need to finish.

10 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:55.216
Like, like the 1st sprint. Yeah, yeah.

11 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:09:55.216 --> 00:10:00.646
Okay.

12 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:10:00.646 --> 00:10:02.177
Okay.

13 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:10:02.177 --> 00:10:20.759
Yeah, I think so. I haven't done any real work on the group projects since our meeting with Callihan cause I was doing the lab and I submitted that at 1156 last night, so.

14 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:28.288
I'm very close to the edge.

15 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:10:28.288 --> 00:10:46.623
Yeah, I also didn't add much I have the basics of the page done, for the image, do we want to pull like the logo or like a a good photo?

16 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:10:46.623 --> 00:10:53.541
Oh, I don't know. What do you guys think? I don't think a group photo would be bad. We.

17 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:55.166
Could probably get that done at.

18 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:57.722
At some point. Yeah, we're gonna do that later.

19 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:10:57.722 --> 00:11:05.146
Yeah, yeah, I'll go over it again and then I'll make a pull request when.

20 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:24.149
The pages done. Oh yeah, now that I got the lab done, I have a lot of the like PHP that we would be using anyways from my labs that I can just like bring over. And then I think I figured out session data, which is just.

21 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:42.501
Basically allowing us to keep data from different pages as we move along, so I would be able to like keep user's profile information that we could just drop onto each page and have that stuff for like scheduling and stuff like that.

22 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.621
Okay.

23 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:11:43.621 --> 00:12:02.189
Yeah, that sounds good. I also did not really do much. I did some more just like random HTML or like, for the other page I was working on. I still need to do CSS for.

24 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:26.536
Like the login and create account pages. I gotta forgot about that and I think that's pretty much it. I, I'm Also I think I created a pull request for the PHP that I wrote and I don't really know if it's right. So.

25 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:30.544
I don't know if you already checked that out, but, at some point.

26 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:12:30.544 --> 00:12:42.723
In the middle of checking it out, but the lab yesterday kind of had me. Yeah yeah it being yesterday was screwing me. Okay, that's pretty much it.

27 "Baimel, Jackson" (2978894848)
00:12:42.723 --> 00:13:02.601
I also haven't really done much, I, I got caught up in all the same stuff with the web system. This coming week though I'm planning on continuing on what I was doing last week, Nothing crazy there.

28 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:40.881
Yeah, Yeah sorry I'm still just working on the, on the this like the search scheduling page and trying to see if there's some, some like a kind of pretty way to display the markers on the map because right now they kind of cover each other. I'm looking for that and have we, we need to have like, I guess a separate meeting to decide what we're gonna do with the, how are we gonna handle the driver's side of the of the website? Like, are you gonna make like driver views?

29 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:13:40.881 --> 00:14:08.101
Or is that like its own page? So I I was kind of thinking about that in regards to the session data and stuff. So I was already thinking about having like a separate account feature for driver stuff and like creating that and then I'd probably have it where you can, where you either log into your, like, user account or your driver account and that changes how the page looks.

30 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:24.079
So I guess probably. Okay, so you can log in with the driver and then I'm just thinking for the like laundry selection process, once the person select neither selects a laundry, a.

31 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:26.642
It's supposed to select a driver.

32 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:14:26.642 --> 00:14:34.063
Yeah, like will, I'm just thinking because that's.

33 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:14:34.063 --> 00:14:36.641
Probably gonna be done by location?

34 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:50.279
Yeah, the same way it is. So it's like each driver, but then it's either it's like a number in a database representing the location or there's some way to.

35 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:14:50.279 --> 00:15:11.241
Handle the, like, what drivers are like active? Maybe that can be another entry in a database, like a driver's table, and when the drive when the user clicks get, when they're searching for a driver, it just carries all the active drivers from the.

36 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:19.935
Table and select the closest one. Yeah, that might be the best option. I I don't know what.

37 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:15:19.935 --> 00:15:34.958
I'll I'll figure that out with you. We can figure out how to create the database and how we want that. I don't, I mean I imagine we could implement like a real time thing, but that'd be.

38 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.314
It's Significantly more difficult?

39 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:15:38.314 --> 00:16:00.617
Yeah, that also seems beyond the scope of this course. Yeah, I don't really want to do it but I don't know how to. We can just use database links. That's why I find yeah we can worry about that later. I'll keep working on them. Well I'll work on the like the.

40 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:16:00.617 --> 00:16:06.155
Schedule schedule an advanced part now. Yeah.

41 "Yau, Caitlin" (70765824)
00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:18.999
Yeah, for me, I did some changes to the HTML and CSS of the homepage.

42 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:22.643
Yeah, that's it. Okay.

43 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:16:22.643 --> 00:16:26.035
Yeah.

44 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:35.876
Do we have a new sprint backlog? I think I don't know if we're supposed to make a new one or if we're just supposed to edit the one we already have.

45 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:16:35.876 --> 00:16:39.356
Okay.

46 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:16:39.356 --> 00:16:49.116
I thought it's we're supposed to make a new one. Okay, then we might need to make a new one on github and just add the stuff, but I don't know if I have time to.

47 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:16:49.116 --> 00:16:55.358
Do that today. Okay I'll I'll just make the project and then we can add our.

48 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:16:55.358 --> 00:17:02.815
Yeah. How are things whenever? Yeah, I I'll individually add to it. It's just, I wanna make sure.

49 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:06.497
Sure I got the comp org homework done. Yeah.

50 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:17:06.497 --> 00:17:08.579
Yeah.

51 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.637
Yeah, i'm using the late day on that.

52 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:17:12.637 --> 00:17:20.634
Well, and then it's long been like, it is very long. I'm on the 5th question.

53 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:17:20.634 --> 00:17:23.238
Okay.

54 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:17:23.238 --> 00:17:29.213
Yeah, you're almost there. Yeah.

55 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:17:29.213 --> 00:17:41.152
Okay, I kinda gotta go. If there's anything like else if you guys like keep talking, I guess let me know.

56 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:17:41.152 --> 00:17:47.232
If there's like I should do. Alright, I don't think I have anything else to say.

57 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:57.574
Unnecessarily. Not really but like I don't think we have to create like a new project like under the status.

58 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:17:57.574 --> 00:18:00.034
Or there's like iteration too, I think we'll use.

59 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:18:00.034 --> 00:18:06.273
That as like our, but we already have like some tasks on there.

60 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:13.315
Sorry just add to the modify it over here. Okay, yeah, that works. I'll add to that the moment that.

61 "Krushel, Cole" (2230285312)
00:18:13.315 --> 00:18:13.964
I'm done with.

62 "Ruan, Amanda" (3436701440)
00:18:13.964 --> 00:18:19.568
The cardboard homework. Yeah, that's good.

63 "Hargreaves, Harry" (3276204544)
00:18:19.568 --> 00:18:23.172
Okay.

64 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:24.985
I gotcha. All right.

65 "Baimel, Jackson" (2978894848)
00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:25.631
Yes.

66 "Voynovich, Matthew" (879892224)
00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:36.756
Alright, we can see you. Yeah, see you. Bye.
