## Issues/Process/Work Log

We began discussing the project on friday and set up everyone's roles and the timeline for the project. I set up a projects page on github and began populating hte to do lists. We used this to track who was working on what and to prevent two people to work on the same thing at the same time. I was assigned to work on annotations and history.

I then began working on the amendments and annotated most of the amendments on friday and sunday, while finishing up the history on monday. Throughout the process of working on the project, I maintained communication with my group via discord and in person talking to make sure that everyone had the materials they needed and all the sections of the website were completed.
