## Overall Contributions

Wrote Annoations for 9 Amendments, specifically Amendments 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 (~2500 words and 8 pages in google docs)

To see the annotations in the google doc without the formatting, here's the link to what I wrote: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x25RTq-JVvDV6PCQgKNy6SMrVA_Qv5w6q1w6xiXyTlE/edit?usp=sharing

## Work Log

I got into a rhythm with the annotations and started doing this for each of them:  
1. Read the article
2. Write the annotation based off the article but rephrased / reinterpreted
3. Copy and paste it to the group doc
4. Added the special character formatting i.e. \n, \\" etc in my annotations in the group doc

I would've added it straight into the json file, but I'm a little nervous about messing up the formatting for the code so I'm not going to do that right now.

Something that I ran into issues with was that I wasn't totally sure who was working on which annotation, so I started working on mine only to realize that there were already annotations for 26 + 27. I added mine as well, so the rest of the group can decide if they use mine or not. Thankfully after doing those 2 I got access to the doc so I didn't have any more issues with that.

In addition, working in a group this big is a little strange as it's harder to know how much you're supposed to do; it's a lot easier to divide work into thirds than sixths. I'm not sure I've solved that one yet, but I'm hoping that we'll be able to take advanage of all the Agile tools to easily divide up the work in a way that's good for everyone for the term project.
