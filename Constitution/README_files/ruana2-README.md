## Things I worked on
- Created simple Figma mockup for general layout of website
- Annotated articles and amendments of the Constitution
  - Articles: 2, 4, 6
  - Amendments: 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 25, 26, 27
- History of the Constitution

## Issues/Process
- Figma mockup
  - I didn't run into any problems with this. The mockup was just to have something
    to build the code towards. We ended up changing the design multiple times throughout
    the process.
- Annotations
  - I struggled to understand some of the Constitution due to the way it's worded
    and my unfamiliarity with some of the words used. I solved this problem by
    looking at an overall summary of the article/amendment to get a better
    base understanding of what I was reading. I also searched up the words I didn't
    know.
  - Another struggle was trying to get all the annotations done. I don't
    particularly like history so going through the Constitution was a bit painful
    but necessary.
- History
  - A struggle was condensing pages of information into a short summary. I tried
    to only contain the important information and exclude facts that might not
    be as interesting.
