## Issues/Process/Work Log

Was on a bit of a time crunch working on this project due to coming back from being away this weekend. Met up with the group on friday before I left to discuss the lab and assign roles. Did majority of the work sunday night and monday day. Was assigned coding and did the majority of it for the website. Finished functionality early and just waiting on people's annotations to come in. Asked around to make sure group was foing ok and whether any help was needed. 

First I created a general information architecture for the website, giving a site map and a general guidline for production. Needed to review a little coding for the lab but working on my website over the summer helped make this a non-issue. Created home page first with the navbar taking inspiration from my portfolio. Then worked on getting a div format for articles/history/amendments that I liked. After figuring out the styling for the page and the formatting, I was able to move on to JSON and JS to dynamically display everything. After that generally asked around and tried to help group members.

TLDR: Did entire website besides table of contents
