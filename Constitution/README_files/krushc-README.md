For this lab I mainly worked on the front end of the project website. I created an initial skeleton for the page with annotation functionality, 
though that was revamped later by Matthew. I added extra features and styling to the front end he created, mainly regarding the table of contents and some styling.
 Overall the lab was a great opportunity to shake some of the rust off of my front-end skills, 
and the biggest roadblocks I faced were dealing with unwanted click event propagation and putting CSS keyframes together.

I also did analysis of one of the Articles of the Constitution, using this site for assistance in understanding it:
https://constitution.findlaw.com/article6.html

I looked at W3Schools.com for some refreshers on certain aspects of styling:
