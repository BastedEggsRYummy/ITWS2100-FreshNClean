Running Log:
I annotated Article 1, Article 3, Article 5, and Article 7. I didn't necessarily encounter any issues as I was reading through the consitution other than vocabulary I didn't know but that was easily solvable through google and I linked the websites I visited. I did not realize the first article was so long however so it did take me a lot of time and motivation to get through annotating that whole article. There was just so much information and it was about a quarter of the entire constitution so I also had trouble making condensing it.
