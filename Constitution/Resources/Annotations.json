        "annotation": "As per section 1, the first article of the constitution lays out the important information of the legislative branch, also known as Congress. They are the United States lawmakers and consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\n\nSection 2 discusses Representatives. The number of representatives and taxes are distributed based on state population, where native Indians are excluded and slaves count as ⅗ of a person. I believe this was a bad turning point in history because this agreement for slave representation is known as the ⅗ compromise which gave slave states more representation, hence providing them with too much power. Each state will have at least one representative and one for every 30,000 people in that state. This allows for fair representation for each state since each state will have representation no matter the size and larger states will have larger representation due to a higher population. The House of Representatives has the power to choose leaders and impeach federal officials. Impeachment is important to penalize federal officials who have committed wrongdoing and could be seen in presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump.\n\nSection 3 discusses Senators. Previously, senators were originally chosen by state legislatures but are now elected by voters as per the 17th Amendment. This is important so state residents have a say in terms of who represents their state in Congress. The Vice President is the president of the Senate but can only vote as a tiebreaker. The Senate also has the power to choose leaders, including the pro tempore who is the acting president of the Senate when the Vice President is absent or acting as President. To balance impeachment power, while the House of Representatives has the power to impeach, the Senate has the power to try all Impeachments, where the Chief Justice will preside and ⅔ votes are required for conviction.\n\nSections 4 and 5 display rules for the operations of both houses and establish checks and balances, coordination, and transparency. An example of checks and balances seen in these sections is that state legislatures set rules for the elections of the senators and representatives while Congress has the power to alter these rules except for where Senators are chosen. As for coordination, the annual meeting of Congress is important so both the House of Representatives and the Senate can gather together to discuss important matters as a whole. Transparency is also important so each house must publish a journal of their proceedings, leaving out parts that require secrecy, and they may not adjourn for more than three days or move locations without consent during their annual meeting.\n\nSections 6 and 7 outline monetary compensation, the protection of it’s members, and law creation. Though probably necessary, I don’t believe members should be protected from arrest during meetings and during travel to and from meetings. I feel that they should not be treated any different from other citizens. Bills must be approved by Congress and then passed to the president. If a president vetoes the bill, Congress may still pass it if theres a ⅔ majority vote. If the president does not act on a bill within ten days, it becomes law unless withdrawn by Congress. I believe these last two statements are very beneficial so that the president does not have too much power and I completely agree in their importance.\n\nSection 8 outlines specific powers of Congress. On the other hand, section 9 is important as it sets limitations on the powers of Congress so that they aren’t provided with too much power. Additionally, Section 10 sets limitations on state powers. This is definitely important for checks and balances and to make sure no branch can abuse their power over the others.\n\nThe entirety of Article 1 is important because it establishes the rules and foundations of Congress and states and provides them with necessary powers while making sure checks and balances are in place and that the United States has a fair legislative system."

        "annotation": "The article layouts the election process of the executive branch, as well as the powers and duties. The executive branch consists of the President and Vice President and are elected by the Electoral College, as described in Section 1. It also states that the presidential nominee must be a U.S. citizen, at least 35 years old, and a U.S. resident for at least 14 years. If the president dies, resigns, is removed, or unable to conduct their duties, then the executive power falls to the Vice President and then to Congress. Sections 2 and 3 of the article describes the President’s powers and duties, such as being the Commander in Chief, the power to pardon, and ensuring laws are faithfully executed (Take Care Clause). The last section of the article highlights that if the President and other civil officers are impeached and charged for treason, bribery, or other crimes and misdemeanors, they can be removed from office.\n\nThis article is important in establishing the powers of the President, but also making sure that they don’t abuse their powers. The executive is kept in check by Congress (treaty-making and appointing positions) and can be kicked out of office if charged for committing a serious crime. This clause was brought up after the January 6th attack on the White House to try to remove Trump from office."

        "annotation": "Article 3 discusses judicial power, which is provided to the Supreme Court and lower courts created by Congress. Judges in these courts may hold their position as a judge for as long as they please as long as they maintain “Good Behavior” (so as long as they aren’t impeached from their position). In return for their service, they will be compensated with a salary that cannot be decreased while they are in office. In my opinion, these last two statements allow for fair treatment of judges while making sure they are fair in return. The only cases that will be sent straight to the Supreme Court are cases involving ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls. All other cases will be heard by the lower courts first. I believe this is a smart decision that allows for organization and fewer cases for the Supreme Court to manage. Regarding criminal cases, except impeachment cases, these trials are determined by a jury. The jury is selected randomly amongst U.S. citizens and they will gather to determine if they believe the suspect is guilty or not. Treason against the United States consists of those who levy war against the U.S. and those who support enemies of the U.S. which is a fair description of those who should be classified as committing treason because of the disloyalty to the country. Congress is given the power to decide the punishment and this punishment cannot extend to family and property can only be forfeited during the lifetime of the convicted.\n\nThis article is important because it outlines the roles and importance of the judicial branch in our government. These are the people who enforce the Constitution and the federal laws created to protect and manage our country. The judiciary is also important for checks and balances to prevent power abuse. The Supreme Court and lower courts are very important in disputing all the matters listed above and our country would not be as civilized without it."

        "annotation": "Article 4 states the relationship between states (Sections 1 and 2) and between states and the national government (Sections 3 and 4). In the first two sections, states are required to recognize the records and judicial rulings of other states and to grant out-of-state residents the same rights as in-state residents. It is also stated that if a criminal flees to another state, it is required to return the fugitive to the original state if demanded.\n\nThe latter two sections discussed the association between the state and the national government. It states that Congress has the right to admit new states but cannot create a state within a state or join two states or parts of two states together without consent from the states’ governments. Congress also has power over the rules and regulations of the country’s territories and property. It is declared that the government will defend the states against foreign invasions and domestic violence.\n\nAlso known as the States’ Relations Article, this article is important in making states accept and be aware of the rulings in other states, as well as keep the peace and harmony between them. The clause regarding returning fugitives to the original state was particularly problematic because it was used in the late 1700s to seize and return slaves back to their owners. It was later invalidated with the abolishment of slavery in the 13th Amendment."

Or if ⅔ of state legislatures agree, Congress must call a convention to propose amendments. When proposed, ¾ of state legislatures agree or conventions in ¾ of states ratify it, then the amendment will then be part of the Constitution. However, any amendment made before 1808 could not alter the first and fourth clauses of the ninth section of the first article, and no state should be deprived of equal representation.\n\nThis article is important because it allows for new amendments to be proposed if deemed necessary and also allows for smaller states to have equal representation in this matter. In regards to the ninth section of the first article, that statement does not matter anymore because Congress passed a law that took effect in 1808 that prohibited the importation of slavery, and later in 1865, slavery was completely abolished."

Some states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, were originally hesitant to ratify the Constitution because they were scared of centralized power. So when the Constitution went into effect on March 9, 1789, both states still did not ratify it until a few months later."

        "annotation": "Lowered the legal voting age in the U.S. to 18 from 21. Congress has the right to enforce this as well.\n\nAfter FDR lowered the draft age to 18 from 21, a slogan for the youth voting rights movement was born: “Old enough to fight, old enough to vote”. \nThis was exacerbated by the Vietnam War. Notoriously unpopular among young Americans, they pointed out the hypocrisy in marches and demonstrations.\n\nPresident Eisenhower, Nixon and congressman Jennings Randolph who introduced 11 voting age bills were some of the strongest voices in this movement.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, which contained a provision regarding voting age being effectively the same thing as the 26th amendment.\nHowever, after Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court narrowly decided congress only has the power to decide voting age for federal elections.\nThe federal voting age was thus set to 18, but without 18-20 year olds being able to vote for local and state elections the system was muddied, confusing and not satisfying to anyone.\nThus began work on transforming the original sentiment into a clean, fully-formed amendment.\n\nThis amendment was immensely popular across all levels of government and the general public.\nFrom 1971 into 1972 the amendment passed unanimously in the senate, with overwhelming majority in the house and in just over 2 months received all the necessary ratifications from state legislatures.\n\nSomething to note is this amendment has had a large impact in politics, as politicians have more of an incentive to market their campaigns to younger audiences."

        "annotation": "Any law regarding a change in the salary of Congress members will only take into effect after the next election of Representatives. This is to prevent Congress members from having the power to increase their own salary.\n\nPrevents Members of Congress from changing their own pay until just after an election.\n\nUnique amongst most of the amendments, it’s been in the process of getting ratified for over 200 years!\n\nOriginally introduced by James Madison as a congressman along with what became the bill of rights.\nWhile it only got 6 states to ratify it by the end of 1791 and had then largely been forgotten, Gregory D. Watson, an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin wrote a paper on it, famously getting a C.\nEnraged, he then became an avid activist for the amendment, eventually getting it ratified on May 7, 1992."
