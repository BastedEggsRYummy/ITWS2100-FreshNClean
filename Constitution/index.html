        <h1>History:</h1>
        <p>
          After the fight for independence, the 13 states continued to be united under the Articles of Confederation, in which the central government had little to no power. Since Congress was unable to collect taxes and ensure a flow of money through the government, it resulted in an increase of inflation and debt. In an attempt to solve this, Congress called for a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation. There were three major plans that were proposed: the Virginia Plan, New Jersey Plan, and Hamilton’s Plan. The Virginia Plan brought up the importance of having a strong national government, while the New Jersey Plan only revised the Articles to give Congress power to raise revenues, regulate commerce, and ratify treaties. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton’s plan brought up the idea of having executive, legislative, and judicial branches to prevent a branch from having too much power. Among all this debate, the question of whether slaves counted as part of the population was brought up, leading to the Great Compromise in which slaves were counted as ⅗ of a person. <br><br>

          On August 6, 1787, the first draft of the Constitution was brought before the convention. The most serious debate that erupted was on the regulation of commerce. If Congress had the power to regulate trade on the goods that the southern states produced (raw materials, crops, etc.), then the New-England dominated Congress could impose export taxes that would harm the economy of the southern states. This also led to a discussion on the morality of slavery and the slave trade, which split the delegates in half. It was only through a bargain (accepting slavery to continue for 20 more years for a majority vote on navigation laws) that the discussion was somewhat resolved. After several sessions, the Constitution was finally ready to be sent to states for approval. <br><br>
          
          When deciding how to properly handle the formation of the new union, the founding fathers were split into two of the original political parties. These two groups were called the federalists and the anti-federalists. The federalists supported a strong central government with a constitution outlining its role. The anti-Federalists on the other hand were against a strong central government and the ratification of a constitution, instead they were in support of bolstering state governments. Some notable federalists included Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, while some famous anti-federalists included Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry. <br><br>
          
          After much debate, both sides settled on a compromise. The constitution was created, and to appease the anti-Federalists’ concerns, a Bill of Rights was added. The Bill of Rights outlined inalienable rights that were assured to the people of the US. This helped to address the worries that the constitution wasn’t protecting the citizens.
